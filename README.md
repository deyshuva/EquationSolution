# EquationSolution
 
a program which will:  
• Accept N consequent values x, x1, x2, and x3 inserted by the user 
from the keyboard. N should be inserted by the user through standard 
input (keyboard) as well.  
• Calculate the value of f for each insert   
• Find the minimum and maximum value for f among all calculated 
values 
• Find the number of the function f which are negative (less than zero), 
equal to zero, and positive (greater than zero)  
 
All results should be printed on the standard output (console window) after 
the program has done the calculations.
